# Japanese Flashcard App - Planning Document

## Overview
This progressive web app (PWA) will provide a clean, lightweight interface for Japanese language study through flashcards. The initial version will focus on creating a smooth flashcard experience without tracking user performance.

## Core Requirements
1. **Frontend-only implementation** - All data will be loaded from a local JSON file
2. **Support for Japanese text** - Must handle Kanji, Hiragana, and Katakana correctly
3. **Furigana support** - Display Hiragana readings above Kanji characters
4. **Clean and lightweight design** - Focus on smooth transitions and good UX
5. **Responsive layout** - Works well on both mobile and desktop devices

## Architecture
The application will be built using the following technologies:
- **HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript** - Core web technologies
- **React** - For component-based UI development
- **CSS Modules or Styled Components** - For component-specific styling
- **Local Storage** - To potentially save study session state

## Data Structure
The flashcard data will be stored in a JSON format:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "1",
    "japanese": {
      "kanji": "日本語",
      "reading": "にほんご"
    },
    "english": "Japanese language"
  },
  {
    "id": "2",
    "japanese": {
      "kanji": "猫",
      "reading": "ねこ"
    },
    "english": "cat"
  }
]
```

## User Experience Flow
1. **Home Screen** - App loads with a simple, clean interface
2. **Flashcard Display** - Shows one card at a time with Japanese on the front
3. **Card Interaction** - Tap/click to flip card and reveal English translation
4. **Navigation** - Swipe or button press to move to next/previous card
5. **Restart** - Option to restart from the beginning or shuffle cards

## UI Components
1. **App Container** - Overall app wrapper with responsive design
2. **Flashcard Component** - The main interactive card with flip animation
3. **Navigation Controls** - Buttons for next/previous/restart
4. **Progress Indicator** - Simple visual indication of position in deck (e.g., "Card 5 of 20")

## Font Requirements
- Include web-safe Japanese fonts that properly display Kanji, Hiragana, and Katakana
- Recommended fonts:
  - "Noto Sans JP", sans-serif
  - "Hiragino Sans", sans-serif
  - "Meiryo", sans-serif

## Animation Considerations
- Smooth card flip animation (3D effect)
- Subtle transition between cards
- Responsive feedback for user interactions

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Progress tracking
- Spaced repetition algorithm
- Multiple decks support
- Customizable study settings
- Audio pronunciation
- Export/import functionality

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize animations for smooth performance
- Lazy load card data if the deck becomes large
- Ensure responsive design works across devices
- Implement proper touch gesture handling for mobile

## Accessibility
- Ensure keyboard navigation works properly
- Maintain sufficient contrast ratios
- Add appropriate ARIA labels

## PWA Requirements
- Use the latest Next.js and Tailwind for the stylinc
- Create manifest.json for installability
- Implement service worker for offline capability
- Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes
